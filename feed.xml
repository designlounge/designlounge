<ol>
<li>Parking lot can be a single floor or multi-floor facility.</li>
<li>There are multiple entry/exit points.</li>
<li>Vehicles allowed in the parking lot are 2 wheelers(bicycles, motorcycles etc.) and 4 wheelers(car, bus, truck etc.</li>
<li>Parking lot has parking spots where vehicles are parked.</li>
<li>Parking spots are of fixed sizes. For simplicity, lets assume a car perfectly fits a standard sized parking lot.</li>
<li>We can park multiple vehicles in a single parking spot. For example, two cycles in the same slot.</li>
<li>For bigger vehicles like buses and trucks, multiple consecutive spots can be assigned.</li>
<li>Customers will be assigned a parking ticket at entry and payment has to be done at exit.</li>
<li>The different payment modes are cash, credit/debit cards, UPI etc.</li>
<li>Vehicles should be assigned the nearest available spots to the entry point. </li>
<li>There can be multiple ways of calculating parking fees. For example, flat $5 per hour for every vehicle, $10 for first 2 hours and $20 for every extra hour above 2 hours. </li>
